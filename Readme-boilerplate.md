## Getting started

First you need to install WordPress locally, using any of the local development environment you prefer. You can use XAMPP, MAMP, WAMP, VVV, Docker or Laravel Valet.

We recommend that you search and replace `theme_name` with your desired theme name.
Change the theme name in these files:

* `theme_name` - theme folder
* `webpack.config.js` - in `themeName` variable
* `postcss.config.js` - in `themeName` variable
* `.gitignore`
* `.eslintignore`
* `package.json` - project name

## Development Pre Start
* `sh _setup.sh` - run script

## Development Start
* `npm start`
  * Builds assets in watch mode using Webpack

## Browser sync
We are using BrowserSync to sync assets cross-device to setup got to `webpack.config.js` and set `proxyUrl` variable to service you are using to show WordPress.
It is tested on MAMP and Vagrant (VVV).

## Linting Assets (JS,SASS)
* `npm run precommit`
  * Lints JS and SASS using Webpack

## Linting PHP ##
We are using [Infinum coding standards for WordPress](https://github.com/infinum/coding-standards-wp) to check php files.

To install it, you need to install [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) first.

* Add this aliases to you bash config:
```
alias phpcs='vendor/bin/phpcs';
alias phpcbf='vendor/bin/phpcbf';
alias wpcs='phpcs --standard=vendor/infinum/coding-standards-wp/Infinum';
alias wpcbf='phpcbf --standard=vendor/infinum/coding-standards-wp/Infinum';
```
* Reload terminal

Checking theme for possible violations:
* `wpcs wp-content/themes/theme_name`

AutoFix theme for minor violations:
* `wpcbf wp-content/themes/theme_name`

## Build
Build creates public folder in theme with js, css, images and fonts

* `sh _prebuild.sh`
  * Check for errors js, css, php but not WP standards
* `sh _build.sh`
  * Builds production ready assets

## Note
* This theme uses OOP with name spaces and autoloader.
